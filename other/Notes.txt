added a backpack and it gave the wrong prices
also, just gives errors whenever I enter an invalid link
Parser should be a global instantiation
Why did you make a class point instead of just importing it?
If you add something and it can't find the product name, it puts null but then adds an additional null. The additional null is overwritten by the next product with a product name
	-One way to fix this might be to make the name be the keywords that were searched
	-Everything we did from Fine Art had this problem
Also what is with the bars next to the prices?
If it's a Sale item, some times it doesn't give you a price. Ex: Vera Bradley large duffle bag
Adding categories doesn't work and neither does the menu bar
If the item has a range of prices, it shows the whole range. When you select a specific item to narrow down the price, it doesn't update it
Also, shipping should always be shown

To Do:
-Items on sale
-get URL from browser
-fix when invalid link is given
